# 100 Days of Code
This is where I document all the projects I made whilst taking Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) Udemy course.
I try to add comments and READMEs to each project when applicable or necessary, so feel free to read those if you're curious.
Note that I usually only upload the biggest and final project of each day, but most days consist of a couple small programs in addition to the main one.

## Here's a gallery of some of my projects, I will try keep this up to date if possible.
